SwiftUI app that streamlines buying and donating surplus food. Includes Firebase-backed sign up/login, a tabbed dashboard feed, seller flow, and profile management.

## Features
- Email/password sign up via Firebase Auth.
- Dashboard feed with item cards and cart sheet.
- Sell flow (`SellScreen`) for posting items.
- Profile view with editable preferences and privacy options.
- Sample data models and view models for items, cart, and users.

## Quick image how-to
- Local images live in `Assets.xcassets`. Add a New Image Set and drop 1x/2x/3x PNGs or PDFs, then reference with the set name.
- Show a bundled image in SwiftUI: `Image("PearBanner").resizable().scaledToFit()`.
- For remote images, use `AsyncImage` with a placeholder stored in `Assets.xcassets`.

## Requirements
- Xcode 15+ with iOS 17+ simulator or device.
- CocoaPods/Swift Package Manager not required (Firebase SDK already linked via project settings).
- Firebase project with iOS app configured.

## Setup
1) Clone the repo and open `SecondServe_DAHacks25.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2) Add your `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `SecondServe/` (replace the placeholder file).
3) In Xcode target settings, set your bundle identifier and team, enable Push/Background modes if needed, and ensure signing succeeds.
4) Build and run on simulator or device.

## Project Structure
- `SecondServe/SecondServeApp.swift`: App entry, initializes Firebase.
- `SecondServe/SignUp.swift`: Email/password signup flow with status messaging and navigation to Dashboard.
- `SecondServe/Dashboard.swift`: Home tab with feed cards and cart sheet.
- `SecondServe/SellScreen.swift`: Listing flow for sellers.
- `SecondServe/ProfileScreen.swift`: Profile, preferences, and privacy controls.
- `SecondServe/ViewModels.swift`: ObservableObject view models for user, items, and cart state.
- `SecondServe/Models.swift` & `SampleData.swift`: Domain models and sample fixtures.
- `SecondServe/ItemDetailView.swift`, `AddItemView 2.swift`, `ContentView 2.swift`, `ImagePicker.swift`: Supporting views/components.

## Running Tests
- Placeholder tests live in `SecondServeTests/`. Add UI/unit tests as features mature.

## Notes
- Firebase Auth and Firestore are referenced; ensure rules and API keys are set in your Firebase console.
- Update assets in `Assets.xcassets` for branding (e.g., `PearBanner` used in the feed).

## Assets & Images
- All image assets live in `Assets.xcassets`. In Xcode, right-click the catalog, add a new Image Set, drop 1x/2x/3x PNGs or PDFs, and name the set (e.g., `PearBanner`).
- Reference images in SwiftUI with `Image("AssetName")` or `Image("AssetName").resizable()` for layouts. Ensure the asset name matches exactly, including capitalization.
- For remote images, wrap `AsyncImage` or a custom loader; local placeholders should still live in `Assets.xcassets`.
- To locate existing assets, open `Assets.xcassets` in Xcode’s navigator and inspect the named sets; the project currently uses `PearBanner` in `Dashboard.swift`.
- Example insertion in SwiftUI:
  ```swift
  Image("PearBanner")
      .resizable()
      .scaledToFit()
      .frame(height: 160)
  ```
